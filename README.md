# 📊 Health Data Analysis Using Python

## 📌 Project Overview
This project performs statistical data analysis and hypothesis testing on a health dataset using Python.
The objective is to analyze relationships between health factors such as age, smoking habits, BMI, and diabetes using inferential statistical techniques.

## 📁 Dataset Description
The dataset contains 200 health records with attributes such as age, gender, BMI, smoking status, diabetes, and other health indicators.

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- SciPy

## 📚 Part A – Theoretical Foundation
- Inferential Statistics
- Hypothesis Testing
- Confidence Interval & Critical Value
- p-value
- Type I & Type II Errors
- z-test, t-test, Chi-square test, ANOVA
- Covariance and Correlation

## 📈 Part B – Data Analysis & Testing Tasks
Statistical tests performed:
- t-test (Age vs Diabetes)
- Chi-square test (Smoking vs Diabetes)
- ANOVA (Age Group vs Diabetes)
- Correlation (Age vs BMI)

Significance Level: α = 0.05

## ✅ Final Results Summary
- All null hypotheses were accepted.
- No significant association found between smoking and diabetes.
- No significant difference in diabetes rates across age groups.
- Very weak correlation between age and BMI.

## 🧠 Conclusion
The analysis concludes that, at a 5% significance level, the dataset does not show statistically significant relationships among the tested variables.
